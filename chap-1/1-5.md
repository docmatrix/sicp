Ben Bitdiddle has invented a test to determine whether the interpreter he is faced with is 
using applicative-order evaluation or normal-order evaluation. He defines the following two procedures:

```lisp
(define (p) (p))

(define (test x y) 
  (if (= x 0) 
      0 
      y))

(test 0 (p))
```

What behavior will Ben observe with an interpreter that uses applicative-order evaluation? 
What behavior will he observe with an interpreter that uses normal-order evaluation? 
Explain your answer. (Assume that the evaluation rule for the special form if is the 
same whether the interpreter is using normal or applicative order: The predicate expression is 
evaluated first, and the result determines whether to evaluate the consequent or the alternative expression.)

1. Applicative order will evaluate p in an infinite loop and never evaluate x
2. Normal order will expand test into the if condition and potentially fall into the infinite loop when evaluating the
(y) parameter, depending if it short circuits the if condition.

> PARTIALLY CORRECT: As identified, the interpreter does short circuit so the (y) parameter is never evaluated.

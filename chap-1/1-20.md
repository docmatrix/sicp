```lisp
(define (gcd a b)
  (if (= b 0)
      a
      (gcd b (remainder a b))))

(gcd 206 40)
(gcd 40 (remainder 206 40))
(gcd 40 6)
(gcd 6 (remainder 40 6))
(gcd 6 4)
(gcd 4 (remainder 6 4))
(gcd 4 2)
(gcd 2 (remainder 4 2))
(gcd 2 0)

In Applicative another remainder call would be done for 

(remainder 2 0)

So 4 calls and 5 calls respectively
```

> FAILURE. Applicative order would have performed 4 as illustrated. Normal order
> would place the remainder call in all places where b is found in the definition,
> which is 3 places per call

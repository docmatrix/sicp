Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose operators are compound expressions.
Use this observation to describe the behavior of the following procedure:

```lisp
(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
  ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))
```

* The 'b' inside the if condition will be evaluated
* If it is larger than 0 then 'a' will be evaluated and 'b' will be evaluated again and the summed result
* If it is smaller than 0 then  'a' will be evaluated and 'b' will be evaluated again and the negated result

> PARTIALLY CORRECT: The end result is a + |b|

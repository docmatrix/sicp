Very small numbers will converge quickly, before a resonable level of accuracy is reached. For instance:

```lisp
(sqrt 0.000001)
0.031260655525445276
```

Also, large numbers will fail to converge, as the floating point accuracy will not reach the specified accuracy due to 
representation:

```lisp
(sqrt 10000000000000)
<inifite loop>
```

A better routine would be:

```lisp
(define (sqrt-iter old-guess new-guess x)
  (if (good-enough? old-guess new-guess)
      new-guess
      (sqrt-iter new-guess (improve new-guess x) x)))

(define (improve guess x)
  (average guess (/ x guess)))

(define (average x y) 
  (/ (+ x y) 2))

(define (square x) (* x x))

(define (old-good-enough? guess x)
  (< (abs (- (square guess) x)) 0.001))

(define (good-enough? old-guess new-guess)
  (< (abs (/ (- old-guess new-guess) old-guess)) 0.001))

(define (sqrt x)
  (sqrt-iter 0.0 1.0 x))
```

```lisp
#lang racket
(include "./projects/sicp/chap-2/common.ss")

(define (generate-huffman-tree pairs)
  (successive-merge 
   (make-leaf-set pairs)))

(define (successive-merge leafs)
  (if (null? (cdr leafs))
      (car leafs)
      (successive-merge
       (adjoin-set
        (make-code-tree (car leafs) (cadr leafs))
        (cddr leafs))))
)
```

> CORRECT. Needed a bit of help for (car leafs)

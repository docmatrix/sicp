          (adjoin-position 
           new-row k rest-of-queens))

(flatmap
 (lambda (new-row)
   (map (lambda (rest-of-queens)
          (adjoin-position 
           new-row k rest-of-queens))
        (queen-cols (- k 1))))
 (enumerate-interval 1 board-size))

; The second takes longer because queen-cols is itself an exponential function. So rather than
; iterating over the linear enumerate-interval, it is iterating over the exponential.
; At a guess it is either T^2 or T^T

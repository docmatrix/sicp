```lisp
#lang racket

(define (for-each func items)
  (if (null? items)
      true
      ((func (car items))
       (for-each func (cdr items)))))

(for-each 
 (lambda (x) (newline) (display x))
 (list 57 321 88))
 
; 57
; 321
; 88
```

> PARTIALLY CORRECT. Crashes at last iteration as tries to apply true as a function
